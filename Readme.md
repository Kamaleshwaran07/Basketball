## Fetching the data

I fetched the data using promise. I got an array in a random order.

So I sorted the data according to Alphabetical order using **sort method** and then fetched that data to display it in the **DOM**.

I used template literal to display the data in a card.

Some objects didn't have height and weight so I provided a default value to display it in the card.
